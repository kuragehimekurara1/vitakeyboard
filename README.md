## About Special Characters
vitakeyboard emulates an actual physical keyboard that would use the `English (US)` layout, so only characters that are in a normal keyboard with that layout are sent.
If other layouts were to be supported, some characters still wouldn't easily be sent. For example, when using the `Portuguese (Brazil)` layout, to send the special character `รก` (that you can find on the vita's virtual keyboard), you'd have to first hit the `\`` key and then the `a` key.
